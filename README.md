# Simple File Transfer Protocol using Tkinter
This is a simple file transfer application built using Tkinter in Python. The application allows users to transfer files between devices over a local network.

## Features
* User-Friendly Interface: The Tkinter GUI provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the application.
* File Selection: Users can select files they want to send or receive using the built-in file dialog.
* Local Network Transfer: The application facilitates file transfer between devices connected to the same local network.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## How to Use
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/JoyAbrian/Simple-FTP
```

* Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd Simple-FTP
```

* Run the application.
```
python FileTransfer.py
```

## Important Notes
* Make sure both devices are connected to the same local network.
* The application uses a basic file transfer protocol. In a production environment, consider implementing security measures for data transfer.
* This is a simple example and may not be suitable for large file transfers or in environments where data integrity and security are critical.
